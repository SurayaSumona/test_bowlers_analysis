In this dataset, there have top bowlers who take almost wickets in their cricket career. Other features also evaluate a    player's performance throughout their career along with wickets. Here are the features we can work with:

 * **Player:** Player's name

 * **Mat:** No. of matches played
 * **Inns:** No. of innings bowled
 * **Balls:** No. of balls bowled
 * **Runs:** No. of runs conceded
 * **Wkts:** Total no. of wickets taken
 * **BBI:** BBI stands for Best Bowling in Innings and only gives the score for one innings,i.e.,9/51 means that 9 wickets for 51 runs allowed
 * **BBM:** BBM stands for Best Bowling in Match and gives the combined score over 2 or more innings in one match
 * **Ave:** Average (runs allowed per wicket taken)
 * **Econ:** Economy rate (runs plus extras allowed per over)
 * **SR:** Strike Rate (balls bowled per wicket taken)
 * **5:** number of times this bowler has taken five wickets in an innings
 * **10:** number of times this bowler has taken ten wickets in a match (over both innings of a test)
 
# Goal of this project:
* **Data Analysis** using with Python's different bulit-in libraries

* **Data Manipulation** with Pandas
* Creating and naming the new data frame
* Find the number of rows and columns in the dataframe
* Find the data statistics of the dataset
* Find the data types and missing values
* Rename column names
